LaTeX receipts from csv file

This program was created in order to automate expense receipts for a number of employees. It takes a csv file with the payment data and it produces the receipts (in Spanish, as per the requirement). The receipts can then be fed into printReceipts, which will arrange them into a letter sized paper for printed output.
